# Odin Connect Four
A Connect Four game implemented in Ruby

In this project I followed a TDD approach where I created RSpec tests for the classes before implementing them. It's ran on the terminal and uses the colorize library to make the display more user friendly.

# Features that can be added to the game or for you to practice:

- Continue the implementation of Database with saving and loading and tests.

- Add a computer AI that can play against the player following an algorithm

- Add different modes to the game (PvP, CvP)
